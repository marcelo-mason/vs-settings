vs-settings
===========

_file naming note: VS 2013.2 - its VS 2013 with Update 2 installed, may work on VS 2013/VS 2013.1 but I can't guarantee that_

To you Colour Theme for VS, please instal [Visual Studio 2013 Color Theme Editor](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9e08e5d3-6eb4-4e73-a045-6ea2a5cbdabe). I do not use `Toos | Option | Environment | Fonts and Colors`. I'm only changing font size there and that's.

**ReSharper-CodeStyle.DotSettings**

R# settings for code style - like when to insert space and when to move code to new line.

**VS-2013.2-TextEditor.vssettings**

Same as with R# but for VS (exported from VS 2013.2) plus few other settings like adding line numbers, opening XAML in XAML editor not Designer, how tabs for me are set up etc.

**VS-2013-TextEditor.vssettings**

Same as with _VS-2013.2-TextEditor.vssettings_. However I've noticed that its not working as it should when imported to VS 2013.2.

**VS-2013.2-Monokai.vstheme**

My colour theme for VS 2013.2. Its based on Monokai Sublime theme - however with few drawbacks. Not everything can be setup same way as in Sublime :(. However I think that it's _good enough_ and ready to be used. I've done some extra work on R# colour settings, but ITS NOT GOOD ENOUGH :) So if you are using R# colour settings then please contribute, thanks :)

**VS-2013-Monokai.theme**

Same as _VS-2013.2-Monokai.vstheme_ but for pure VS 2013 and VS with Update 1. Not sure if it will work with VS 2012 but you can try it. DO NOT USE IT ON VS 2013.2 - there are few colours that are not imported properly as well as you will need to change extension name to vstheme to be able to import it.
